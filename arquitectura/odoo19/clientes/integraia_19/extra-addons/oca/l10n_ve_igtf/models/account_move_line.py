        Updates the 'balance' (company currency amount) whenever the 'amount_currency' 
        or 'currency_id' changes, ensuring a symmetric rounding.

        This method addresses the common floating-point discrepancy where a balance 
        converted to foreign currency and then back to company currency results in 
        a small difference (e.g., 0.01). 

        The logic performs a "Symmetry Test":
        1. It calculates the initial balance using the current exchange rate.
        2. It simulates a back-conversion to the foreign currency.
        3. If the back-conversion doesn't match the original 'amount_currency' due to 
        rounding noise, it applies a micro-adjustment to the 'balance' in the 
        company currency (VES) to force a perfect match.
